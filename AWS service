A cutting-edge serverless email marketing application powered by AWS
I've developed an innovative email application that streamlines the distribution of programming puzzles among my contacts. It's the perfect solution for seamlessly sending engaging content to my email list.
Here's a breakdown of the 5 AWS Services I've utilized to create this powerful application:
 Amazon S3: A reliable storage solution for email contact files and descriptions, ensuring seamless data management with unparalleled scalability.
Amazon SES: Simplifying email sending by efficiently handling sender and receiver emails, guaranteeing reliable delivery and compliance with industry standards.
AWS Lambda: Seamlessly connecting S3 and SES, automating processes and facilitating smooth communication between different components of the application.
IAM Policy: Implementing secure access control with IAM policies, ensuring each component can interact securely while maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.
EventBridge: Leveraging the power of EventBridge for scheduling email campaigns at the optimal time, ensuring emails reach recipients at the most opportune moments.
